# ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire and Smoke Detection Using Deep Learning

This repository contains the complete implementation of a deep learning-based system for detecting forest fires and smoke using object detection, super-resolution enhancement, classification, and zero-shot learning. The goal is to build a scalable, intelligent, and deployable early warning system that can be used in real-time forest monitoring scenarios.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The project uses a multi-stage pipeline for detecting and classifying fire and smoke in natural environments:

1. YOLOv8 is used for high-speed object detection to locate fire/smoke regions in forest surveillance images.
2. ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN) improves the quality of detected region patches for better classification.
3. MobileNetV2 classifies cropped and enhanced regions into either fire or smoke.
4. CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) is used for zero-shot classification and image-to-text matching.
5. Streamlit frontend makes the system user-accessible for real-time detection.
